This project contains word count totals for the webserial *Worm*, by Wildbow.

Also included is the shitty code I used to generate it. A lot was done manually so don't expect it all to work out of the box. Well, pull.php will probably work perfectly. parse.php needs a little tweaking for each output, but it's easy enough to figure out.

(but no for reals this code is janky af dont judge me)
